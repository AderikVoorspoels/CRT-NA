# CRT-NA
Control-in-Real-Time-of-Nucleic-Acids

NOTICE: THIS IS STIL UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT, MAJOR CHANGES CONTINUE TO BE MADE

CRT-NA is a tool for the real time analysis and control of Rigid Base parameters during simulation
It is developped to work during Gromacs simulation as a part of plumed

Instalation is in priciple as straight forward as copying the source code of CRT-NA to the colvar folder of your plumed instalation
and subsequently recompiling and installing plumed

The code comes in two forms: CRT-NA and CRT-NAnoder the first being the main version which can both analyze and control nucleic acids in real time
while the second is a lighter version that has only the ability to analyze in real time.
