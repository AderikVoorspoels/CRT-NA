# RBB-NA
Rigid-Base-Biassing-for-Nucleic-Acids

NOTICE: THIS IS STIL UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT, MAJOR CHANGES CONTINUE TO BE MADE

RBB-NA is a tool for the real time analysis and control of Rigid Base parameters during simulation
It is developped to work during Gromacs simulation as a part of plumed

Instalation is in priciple as straight forward as copying the source code of CRT-NA to the colvar folder of your plumed instalation
and subsequently recompiling and installing plumed

The code comes in two forms: RBB-NA and RBB-NAnoder the first being the main version which can both analyze and control nucleic acids in real time
while the second is a lighter version that has only the ability to analyze in real time. 

Some Examples are included to illustrate the used syntax. Note that these might require some computation time (depening on the hardware).
