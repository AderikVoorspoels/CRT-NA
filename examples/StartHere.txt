To help you start in the repository 4 examples have been included:

-constraining the Stretch
-Pulling the Tilt
-Using the Pairmode to constraining the Propeller
-Using the Stepmode to pull the Rise


All are made to work with plumed 2.8 and gromacs 2020.4.
they should however function with any later plumed and gromacs versions as long as they are compatible amongst each other.

Before running through any of these however you will need to generate the proper starting setup.
This entails using Gromacs to obtain an file with the coordinates of the Drew-Dickerson-Dodecamer, equilibrated to the NPT ensemble.
It is from this file all further tutorial will start. 
To generate this file navigate to the initial Data folder and execute the following steps:

	- generate a .gro and .top file from the .pdb file by running: gmx pdb2gmx -f 1bna.pdb -o 1bna.gro
	  when prompted choose the tip3p water model and the recomended force field for DNA (preferably AMBER bsc1)
	- define the simulation box (a dodecahedral box with 2 nm extra space on either side of the molecule) by running: gmx editconf -f 1bna.gro -o box.gro -c -d 2.0 -bt dodecahedron
	- fill the box with water molecules by: gmx solvate -cp box.gro -cs spc216.gro -o solvated.gro -p topol.top
	- prepare to add some salt by(make sure the ions.mdp file is compatible with the forcefield you're using): gmx grompp -f ../Control/ions.mdp -p topol.top -c solvated.gro -o ions.tpr
	- than actually add it (using NaCL ad a concentration of 150mM) with: gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o concentration.gro -p topol.top -pname NA -nname CL -conc 0.15 -neutral
	when prompted select the SOL (solvent) to be replaced by salt
	- prepare to run some energy minimization to remove overlap between water and molecule: gmx grompp -f ../Control/minim.mdp -c concentration.gro -p topol.top -o em.tpr
        - execute the energy minimization : gmx mdrun -deffnm em -v
        - prepare to start md in the NVT ensemble: gmx grompp -f ../Control/nvt.mdp -c em.gro -r em.gro -o nvt.tpr
        - execute the NVT equilibrqtion run : gmx mdrun -deffnm nvt -v
        - prepare to start md in the NPT ensemble: gmx grompp -f ../Control/npt.mdp -c nvt.gro -r nvt.gro -t nvt.cpt -o npt.tpr
        - execute the NPT equilibrqtion run : gmx mdrun -deffnm npt -v
        
Now the files npt.gro, npt.cpt and topol.top contain the onformation needed to start molecular dynamics while Controlling, In Real Time the dNA.
To do this you can start any of the 4 tutorials.
